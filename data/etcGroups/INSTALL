This consists mainly a pre-compiled java applet,
to recompile it, use './build.sh' 
but this is not necessary.

Untar this in a web accessible folder,
change the hostname to your hostname with :
'./set-host.sh <myhost>'
eventually, change the applet's parameters in fapplet.html
( in SQL mode, you'll need to create a database
with tables nodes and edges,
and change the database password, host , user )

then the example will be available at :
http://<myserver>/etc/groups.html

-- optional : thumbnails extraction

In order to make thumbnail extraction work,
you will need to install :

* perl

the following perl module  :
* Data::UUID
  you can install it with :
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Data::UUID'

* khtml2png2
  ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/khtml2png/ )

* Image Magick
  ( http://www.imagemagick.org )

Then install Xvfb (http://www.xfree86.org/4.4.0/Xvfb.1.html),
then change this parameter in tnconf.pm :
$display = "localhost:99.0";

To run thumbnail extraction, start Xvfb and then './run-tn.sh'.

Enjoy !
